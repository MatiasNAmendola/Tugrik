Tugrik - ORM for PHP and MongoDB
================================

Tugrik is an abstraction layer for MongoDB written in PHP.

It will allow you to store PHP objects directly in a MongoDB database
without converting them to an array. It will handle relations between 
objects.

* Requires PHP 5.3+
* Pre-alpha state - use at your own risk.
